# Examples of the `wasm-tools` API

This directory contains a number of examples of using the `wasm-tools` API from
different languages. Currently examples are all in Rust and C using the
`wasm-tools` crate or the wasmtime embedding API.

The `CMakeLists.txt` in this folder can be used to build C examples.
