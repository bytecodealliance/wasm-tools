Validate a WebAssembly binary

This subcommand will validate a WebAssembly binary to determine if it's valid or
not. This implements the validation algorithm of the WebAssembly specification
<https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/index.html>. No output is printed
if the binary is valid; an error message is printed to stderr if the binary is
not valid. A WebAssembly text file can also be used.

Extra information will be included in the error message if the input WebAssembly
binary contains DWARF debugging information.

Usage: wasm-tools validate [OPTIONS] [INPUT]

Arguments:
  [INPUT]
          Input file to process.
          
          If not provided or if this is `-` then stdin is read entirely and
          processed. Note that for most subcommands this input can either be a
          binary `*.wasm` file or a textual format `*.wat` file.

Options:
      --generate-dwarf <lines|full>
          Optionally generate DWARF debugging information from WebAssembly text
          files.
          
          When the input to this command is a WebAssembly text file, such as
          `*.wat`, then this option will instruct the text parser to insert
          DWARF debugging information to map binary locations back to the
          original source locations in the input `*.wat` file. This option has
          no effect if the `INPUT` argument is already a WebAssembly binary or
          if the text format uses `(module binary ...)`.

  -g
          Shorthand for `--generate-dwarf full`

  -f, --features <FEATURES>
          Comma-separated list of WebAssembly features to enable during
          validation.
          
          If a "-" character is present in front of a feature it will disable
          that feature. For example "-simd" will disable the simd proposal.
          
          The placeholder "all" can be used to enable all wasm features and the
          term "-all" can be used to disable all features.
          
          The default set of features enabled are all WebAssembly proposals that
          are at phase 4 or after. This means that the default set of features
          accepted are relatively bleeding edge. Versions of the WebAssembly
          specification can also be selected. The "wasm1" or "mvp" feature can
          select the original WebAssembly specification and "wasm2" can be used
          to select the 2.0 version.
          
          Available feature options can be found in the wasmparser crate:
          <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/blob/main/crates/wasmparser/src/features.rs>

  -v, --verbose...
          Use verbose output (-v info, -vv debug, -vvv trace)

      --color <COLOR>
          Configuration over whether terminal colors are used in output.
          
          Supports one of `auto|never|always|always-ansi`. The default is to
          detect what to do based on the terminal environment, for example by
          using `isatty`.
          
          [default: auto]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Examples:

    # Validate `foo.wasm` with the default Wasm feature proposals.
    $ wasm-tools validate foo.wasm

    # Validate `foo.wasm` with more verbose output
    $ wasm-tools validate -vv foo.wasm

    # Validate `fancy.wasm` with all Wasm feature proposals enabled.
    $ wasm-tools validate --features all fancy.wasm

    # Validate `mvp.wasm` with the original wasm feature set enabled.
    $ wasm-tools validate --features=wasm1 mvp.wasm
    $ wasm-tools validate --features=mvp mvp.wasm

Exit status:
    0 if the binary is valid,
    nonzero if the binary is not valid.
