    <strong>Rust tooling for low-level manipulation of WebAssembly modules</strong>

# Tools included

This project is intended to house a number of tools related to the low-level
workings of WebAssembly. The top-level crate here ties everything together but
isn't currently intended for general use. Instead you probably want to take a
look at the sub-crates:

* [**`wasmparser`**](crates/wasmparser) - a library to parse WebAssembly binaries
* [**`wat`**](crates/wat) - a library to parse the WebAssembly text format
* [**`wast`**](crates/wast) - like `wat`, except provides an AST
* [**`wasmprinter`**](crates/wasmprinter) - prints WebAssembly binaries in their
  string form
