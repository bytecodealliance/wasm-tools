//! Support for deduplicating module imports when turning them into a component.
//!
//! Core wasm allows for duplicate imports of the same name/field in a core wasm
//! module. This is not allowed in the component model, however, meaning that
//! such a core wasm module cannot be inserted into a component as-is. This
//! module is tasked with tackling this problem.
//!
//! The general idea of this module is to rewrite imports in-place to a
//! different and unique name. The original name is then recorded in
//! [`ModuleImportMap`] which is then plumbed through to the location that
//! classifies all imports. The classification then uses the original names for
//! what an import should be resolved to but records it under the unique names
//! generated here.
