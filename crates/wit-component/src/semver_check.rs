/// Tests whether `new` is a semver-compatible upgrade from the world `prev`.
///
/// This function is will test whether a WIT-level semver-compatible predicate
/// holds. Internally this will ignore all versions associated with packages and
/// will instead test for structural equality between types and such. For
/// example `new` is allowed to have more imports and fewer exports, but types
/// and such must have the exact same structure otherwise (e.g. function params,
/// record fields, etc).
//
// NB: the general implementation strategy here is similar to the `targets`
// function where components are synthesized and we effectively rely on
// wasmparser to figure out everything for us. Specifically what happens is:
//
// 1. A dummy component representing `prev` is created.
// 2. A component importing a component of shape `new` is created.
// 3. The component from (2) is instantiated with the component from (1).
//
// If that all type-checks and is valid then the semver compatible predicate
// holds. Otherwise something has gone wrong.
//
// Note that this does not produce great error messages, so this implementation
// likely wants to be improved in the future.

    // string matching.
    //
    // This can leave `resolve` in a weird state which is why this function
    // takes ownership of `resolve`. Specifically the internal maps for package
    // names won't be updated and additionally this could leave two packages
    // with the same name (e.g. no version) which would be a bit odd.
    //
    // NB: this will probably cause confusing errors below if a world imports
    // two versions of a package's interfaces. I think that'll result in weird
    // wasmparser validation errors as there would be two imports of the same
    // name for example.
