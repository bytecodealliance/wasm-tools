# Enables JSON serialization/deserialization of the wit-encoder structures.

# *Note*: The JSON that this generates is different from the JSON generated from wit-parser.
# If you're looking to create WIT from JSON, then this is the crate and feature for you. But if
# you're parsing WIT and reading the output through JSON, then wit-parser is probably the better
# option.

# *Note*: The exact structure of the JSON is likely not going to be very stable over time,
# so slight tweaks and variants should be expected as this crate evolves.
