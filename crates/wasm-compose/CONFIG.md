# Configuring `wasm-compose`

`wasm-compose` can be configured using a YAML configuration file.

To specify the configuration file to use, pass the `--config` option to
`wasm-tools compose`.

The configuration file has the following top-level fields:

* `search-paths` : `list<string>` (optional) - a list of paths to search for dependencies.
* `skip-validation` : `bool` (optional) - a boolean indicating whether to skip 
  validation of the resulting composed component.
* `dependencies` : `map<string, dependency>` (optional) - a map specifying the explicit
  locations of transitive dependencies.
* `instantiations` : `map<string, instantiation>` (optional) - a map specifying the explicit
  instantiations of transitive dependencies.

## Dependencies

Each `dependency` specifies a path where `wasm-compose` may locate a dependency, rather
than searching the configured search paths.

A dependency has the following fields:

* `path` : `string` - the path to the WebAssembly component file; the path is
  relative to the configuration file.

* `import` : `string` (optional) - the name to use for importing the component.
  If not present, the component at the given path will be defined directly in
  the composed component.

Dependencies may be specified as a `string` rather than a `map`, in which case
it is treated as having a `path` field with the value of the string.

### Dependencies example

An example of specifying dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  a: a.wasm
  b:
    path: b.wasm
    import: b
```

In the above example, two dependencies are defined in the configuration:

* `a` - the contents of `a.wasm` will be defined directly in the composed component.
* `b` - a component of the same type as `b.wasm` will be imported in the composed
  component with name `b`; the original file will not be embedded in the composed
  component.

_Note: importing components from a composed component is not currently supported in_
_[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)._

Dependency names should match the expected name of imports from components in the
component graph.

## Instantiations

Each `instantiation` specifies how a particular dependency is to be instantiated, even
allowing a dependency to be instantiated multiple times.

An instantiation has the following fields:

* `dependency` : `string` (optional) - the name of the dependency to instantiate.
  If unspecified, the instantiation will be for a dependency of the same name as the
  instantiation itself.

* `arguments` : `map<string, argument>` (optional) - a mapping of argument names to
  arguments; argument names match the names of the imports of the dependency being
  instantiated.

Note that the instantiation name `$component` is special and signifies how the input
component is to be instantiated.

### Instantiation arguments

Each `argument` specifies exactly which instance should be provided as argument to the
instantiation of a dependency.

An argument has the following fields:

* `instance` : `string` - the name of the instance to pass as the argument.

* `export` : `string` (optional) - the name of the exported instance on `instance` to use
  as the argument; if not present, the instance specified by `instance` will be passed
  directly.

Arguments may be specified as a `string` rather than a `map`, in which case
it is treated as having an `instance` field with the value of the string.

## Instantiations example

A slightly complex example of configuring instantiations:

```yaml
instantiations:
  $component:
    arguments:
      a: b
  b:
    arguments:
      c:
        instance: d
        export: e
  d:
    dependency: f
```

In the above example, the `$component` instantiation (i.e. the root instantiation) has explicitly
specified that the argument named `a` is to be provided instance `b`.

It also defines an instantiation named `b` which is to be passed an instance export named `e`
from instance `d` (of a dependency named `f`) for the instantiation argument named `c`.

By default, `wasm-compose` will minimize the number of instantiations and dependencies which share
an import of the same name will share the same instance of that dependency, provided that the
instance is compatible with every import.

Configuring instantiations for `wasm-compose` allows for a custom instantiation graph to be
constructed in the composed component.
